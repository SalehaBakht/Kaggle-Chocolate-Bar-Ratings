# Kaggle-Chocolate-Bar-Ratings

The Python notebook includes the data cleaning from the original Kaggle dataset. Then I explored the dataset to see if there were any interesting patterns. Finally, I attempted to answer the questions provided on the Kaggle competition page, found here https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings. A table of contents is provided in the Python notebook for better navigation.
